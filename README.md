TOSCA_Artifacts
===============

Proof Of concept prototypes( Java Web Services) for OpenTOSCA
  
These are all built as java based web services using Carbon WSO2 application server!



These are implemented as PoC for http://www.tosca-open.org/ (OpenTosca standardization Project)

Tosca - Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications.

These services are implementation artificats that are written as "quick and dirty" prototypes to understand Tosca better and to identify gaps in concepts.
